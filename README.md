 Google Material design icons adaptation for Magento 2
 Version: 0.01

 Created by Victor Slivinsky 07.08.2016

 This lib extend default Google Material icons lib.
 I have implemented 2 extra variants of  usage Material design icons:

 1 - Individual usage. Allows set icons as ":before" element for any page element.
     You don't need to modify template files. Use this structure
```
 .any_class_name:before {
    @extend .material-icons;
    content: 'label';
  }
```
  For IE9 or below
```
 .any_class_name:before {
    @extend .material-icons;
    content: '\e84d';
  }
```
 2 - BEM Model. Based on 2 classes:
 ".material-icons" -as element class and
 ".material-star"  -as class modificator
 create an inline element with the appropriate classes, like so:
```
 <a href="#"><span class="material-icons material-star"></span> Star</a>
 ```
 There "star" is name of icon. You can find all names and connected on Google page:
 https://design.google.com/icons/

 Load fonts from this directory. This path is default for Magento.
 It is relative path from YourTheme/web/css folder.
